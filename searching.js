//Linear Search
//A basic search algorithm that checks every element until the right one is found
//Worst case is that the program will have to go over every element

//Binary Search
//If the input list is sorted Binary search is the better algorithm to use O(log(n))

//Breadth first search
//Start from the first node, then move from left to right in the second level and so on.
//Uses additional memory because this method needs to track every child node

//Depth first search
//Goes down all the way to the leaf node, then checks if the parent of left leaf node 
//has a right child if not then the program returns to the root node

//BFS vs DFS
//BFS and DFS have an O(n) time complexity
//BFS has the shortest path and closer nodes, but uses more memory
//DFS use less memory, useful to check if path exists, can get slow
